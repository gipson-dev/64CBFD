# Conker's Bad Fur Day (N64) Decompilation

A work-in-progress decompilation of *Conker's Bad Fur Day* for the
Nintendo 64.

This repository does not include any game assets or ROMs. You must provide
your own legally obtained copy of the game to build it.

## Current progress

Snapshot as of 2026-07-17 after the 25% game C milestone. Functions converted from raw assembly to C
(`make -C conker progress NON_MATCHING=1`):

| Section | Progress bytes | Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| total | `[##----------------------]` 8.86% | 1807 / 6035 (29.94%) |
| init | `[######------------------]` 25.18% | 297 / 538 (55.20%) |
| game | `[##----------------------]` 6.71% | 1329 / 5313 (25.01%) |
| debugger | `[########################]` 99.19% | 181 / 182 (99.45%) |

Of those C-converted functions, the share that already compiles to the
exact retail bytes (`make -C conker match-progress NON_MATCHING=1`):

| Section | Byte-exact | Blocked on address drift | Still differ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| total | 692 / 1807 (38.30%) | 840 | 275 |
| init | 74 / 297 (24.92%) | 162 | 61 |
| game | 496 / 1329 (37.32%) | 665 | 168 |
| debugger | 122 / 181 (67.40%) | 13 | 46 |

The debugger overlay's long-standing rodata displacement healed on
2026-07-16: its printf engine was identified as Plauger's Standard C
Library (the N64 SDK's libc) and rematched at exact retail sizes. Later
game-section layout fixes (`func_1504B0FC`, `func_1504BE2C`, and
`func_150721A4`) collapsed most address-drift blockers. The latest game
decomp push then traded some byte-match cleanliness for 107 more game
functions converted from raw asm to C, crossing the 25% game raw-conversion
target.
Debugger raw conversion is now complete except `func_16003650`, a CP0/TLB
reader that uses `tlbr`/CP0 register instructions and is intentionally left
as raw assembly. The new C bodies are raw-progress placeholders, so the
byte-match table is expected to stay lower until those functions are
size-matched or padded back into retail layout. The latest init/libultra
push also replaced early-link OS/PI/SI/AI helpers, so many otherwise-good
rows are temporarily classified as address-drift blocked.
The ROM mapping helper now reads code-section starts from `conker.<version>.yaml`,
finds `symbol_addrs.<version>.txt` even when using a temporary progress CSV,
and resolves `D_XXXXXXXX` data labels from their name-implied retail VRAM.

"Blocked on address drift" functions only differ in `j`/`jal` targets or
`%lo` halves of shifted symbol addresses and will self-resolve as the
functions/data they reference get matched. When
regenerating, update these tables together with the copies in
[DOCS/README.md](DOCS/README.md) and [DOCS/PROJECT.md](DOCS/PROJECT.md).
