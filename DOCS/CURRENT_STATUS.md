# Current Decomp Status

Last verified: 2026-09-25

This page is the short, current handoff for `64CBFD`. Historical experiments
remain in [WORKING_NOTES.md](WORKING_NOTES.md); detailed session handoffs live
under [WORKING_NOTES/](WORKING_NOTES/).

## Repository state

- Branch: `master`
- The restoration baseline is banked in coherent commits beginning after
  `2ed3523` (`tool updates`): generated-slice assembly support, restored guest
  routines, OGL reference tooling, RGBA5551 tooling, and documentation.
- Before checkpointing, `git status --short` reported 123 changed tracked paths
  and 37 untracked paths. The empty personal `DOCS/user notes.md` remains
  preserved locally and excluded through `.git/info/exclude`.
- The broad assembly restoration in the current tree is buildable, but it
  reduced the number of functions represented in C. It improves original-code
  coverage and port support; it is not C-decomp completion.

## Measured progress

Fresh `progress.csv` and linked retail comparison on 2026-09-25:

| Section | C functions | Raw assembly | C bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Total | 5,489 / 6,038 (90.91%) | 549 | 1,932,840 / 2,256,728 (85.65%) |
| Init | 508 / 538 (94.42%) | 30 | 148,936 / 164,048 (90.79%) |
| Game | 4,800 / 5,318 (90.26%) | 518 | 1,764,264 / 2,072,880 (85.11%) |
| Debugger | 181 / 182 (99.45%) | 1 | 19,640 / 19,800 (99.19%) |

| Section | Byte-exact C | Address drift | Different C |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Total | 2,560 / 5,489 (46.64%) | 1 | 2,928 |
| Init | 387 / 508 (76.18%) | 1 | 120 |
| Game | 1,992 / 4,800 (41.50%) | 0 | 2,808 |
| Debugger | 181 / 181 (100.00%) | 0 | 0 |

The full debugger inventory is complete: all 181 C-classified tracked rows are
linked byte-exact, and the sole remaining assembly row, the original
handwritten 40-word CP0/TLB routine `func_16003650`, independently matches all
40 retail words. It remains assembly by design because IDO C cannot emit its
`mtc0`, `tlbr`, and `mfc0` instruction sequence. Thus all 182 debugger rows
are accounted for and exact; 181 / 181 is only the C-matcher denominator.

The percentage increase from the old July matching snapshot remains primarily
denominator driven: the exact count is now 2,560, while
489 functions moved from C back to assembly. The paired event-swap pass added
two byte-exact functions and the debugger rectangle-fill, float-formatter,
glyph-blitter, `_Printf`, context-display, memory-view, and debugger-main-loop
passes added one each after the restoration baseline. The subsequent game
pass completed `func_15135480`, the final four one-difference game rows, and
the subsequent small game queue through `func_1509D054`; `func_150A7A00` was
then correctly restored from a false C placeholder to its original trampoline,
followed by handwritten PRNG seed setter `func_150ADACC`, the guarded
scalar-temporary match for `func_150BDB3C`, the guarded set-bit temporary
match for `func_150F33B0`, and the relocation-preserving opening-load match
for `func_151254F4`; `func_1515FB70` was then restored from a false C model
to its original nine-word assembly extent, followed by the guarded register
normalization for `func_1505841C`, indexed-slot clear `func_150F02A0`, and
call-ABI correction for `func_151B2FA0`, and byte-offset expression recovery
for `func_150770E4`.
Handwritten byte-fill loop `func_150A7770` is restored from its false C model
to the original eight-word assembly extent. Packed fixed-point reader
`func_1515F008` is byte-exact through guarded pointer/value register
normalization. Packed-byte scalers `func_1516F8EC` and `func_1516F91C` are
byte-exact through symmetric guarded temporary-register normalization, while
`func_1516F984` matches from a source-level scaled-field lifetime.
Viewport setup `func_15019BB8` is byte-exact through guarded frame-size and
relocation-preserving address-register normalization.
Sound-command wrapper `func_1509F6B0` is byte-exact through guarded incoming
argument spill/reload scheduling.
`func_10012588` remains the sole address-drift blocker.

## Verified build state

These commands passed from the current checkout on 2026-09-25:

```sh
make -C conker replace NON_MATCHING=1 -j4
make tools-check
make NON_MATCHING=1 -j4
make -C conker match-progress NON_MATCHING=1
```

The successful non-matching build establishes that the current source links
and emits `conker.us.bin`. It does not establish a matching ROM hash or fresh
end-to-end gameplay acceptance.

## Resume boundary

1. The restoration baseline is banked. Do not fold a broad conversion batch
   into it; future work should start from a new focused commit.
2. Debugger is complete: 181 / 181 C-classified rows and the one handwritten
   assembly routine are linked byte-exact. Preserve the guarded
   `func_16000B14` normalization while broader matching continues.
3. The original `func_150AD780`/`func_150AD78C` trig slice is restored, and
   `func_150849A0` is byte-exact from a source-level index-lifetime fix, and
   `func_150636A4` is byte-exact through a guarded nested-pointer lifetime
   normalization, and `func_1514672C` is byte-exact through a guarded
   relocation-preserving load reorder. `func_15199980` is byte-exact from an
   explicit callback-pointer lifetime, `func_1505D024` is byte-exact through
   guarded call-argument register normalization, and `func_15071A64` is
   byte-exact from corrected stack-local declaration order, and
   `func_15087DCC` is byte-exact from separating the global base load from the
   indexed record pointer, and `func_1509D054` is byte-exact through guarded
   call-argument lifetime normalization. The five-word `func_150A7A00` is now
   restored as its original synthetic-return assembly trampoline,
   `func_150ADACC` is restored as handwritten assembly, `func_150BDB3C` is
   byte-exact through guarded scalar-temporary normalization, and
   `func_150F33B0` is byte-exact through guarded set-bit temporary
   normalization, and `func_151254F4` is byte-exact through guarded
   relocation-preserving opening-load scheduling. The nine-word
   `func_1515FB70` is restored to assembly ownership after its C model proved
   unable to preserve the retail undefined-return branch shape.
   `func_1505841C` is byte-exact through guarded FP-temporary and global-load
   register normalization. `func_150F02A0` is byte-exact after making its
   base-pointer and index lifetimes explicit and guarding the remaining
   temporary-register choices. `func_151B2FA0` is byte-exact after correcting
   its forwarded argument and callee declaration from `s16` to `s32`.
   `func_150770E4` is byte-exact after expressing its table lookup as retail's
   combined 812-byte stride. Handwritten `func_150A7770` is restored to its
   original eight-word assembly extent after the C model overflowed the slot.
   `func_1515F008` is byte-exact through six guarded, non-relocating
   pointer/value register choices. The adjacent `func_1516F8EC`,
   `func_1516F91C`, and `func_1516F984` cluster is byte-exact, completing the
   six-difference game tier. `func_15019BB8` is now byte-exact through seven
   guarded frame/address words. `func_1509F6B0` is byte-exact through seven
   guarded spill/reload scheduling words. Continue at 14-word
   `func_150C7930`, the next seven-difference game row.
4. Treat raw-assembly conversion as a separate queue. Start by reviewing the
   smallest game-owned rows in `progress.csv`; exclude SDK, CP0, handwritten,
   and mixed code/data routines before converting anything.
5. After every source change, relink and rerun `match-progress`. Update public
   percentages only from a fresh linked scan.
