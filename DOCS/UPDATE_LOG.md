### Build environment and decomp progress

- Fixed a broken local build environment (pre-existing, not caused by this
  session): incorrect `core.symlinks`/`core.autocrlf` git config had left
  ~450 tracked files checked out with CRLF line endings and broken symlinks,
  which silently broke the IDO compiler. Fixed locally; see
  [`DOCS/WORKING_NOTES.md`](WORKING_NOTES.md) for the exact recovery steps
  if this recurs in a fresh clone or devcontainer.
- Fixed two `tools/n64splat` submodule version-compatibility bugs in this
  project's own extension code/config (`tools/splat_ext/rzip.py`,
  `conker/conker.us.yaml`, new `conker/include/asm_processor_prelude.inc`)
  that were blocking `make extract` and the C compile entirely.
- Ported 56 functions (46 `game`, 10 `debugger`) from the untracked
  `ects_proto/` reference checkout (targets the ECTS prototype ROM) into
  this repo's `conker/src/`, replacing raw-assembly stubs with real matched
  C, and added the struct fields/globals/prototypes those functions needed.
  12 of the 56 byte-match the US retail ROM exactly out of the box; the
  other 44 compile cleanly and are marked `// NON-MATCHING: ported from
  ects_proto (ECTS ROM build), not yet byte-verified for us` pending a real
  matching pass. Also fixed one small pre-existing bug found along the way
  (a call site in `game_1944C0.c` missing an argument).
- Fixed a long-standing link-time blocker: 26 jump-table `rodata` segments
  in `conker/conker.us.yaml` were declared as standalone segments, causing
  1153 `undefined reference` errors at link time once code near them got
  matched. Changed them to `bin` (opaque byte blobs - jump table contents
  don't need symbolic disassembly). Full root-cause writeup in
  [`DOCS/WORKING_NOTES.md`](WORKING_NOTES.md).
- `make -C conker --jobs` → `make -C conker replace NON_MATCHING=1` →
  `make` (repo root) now runs end to end for the first time, producing a
  real (correctly non-matching, ~20% complete) `build/conker.us.z64`.
  Regenerated the progress table in [`DOCS/PROJECT.md`](PROJECT.md) from
  this working build - it's the first `.map`-file-derived count this
  checkout has actually produced, so it supersedes the previously
  documented (never locally re-verified) numbers.

### Planning docs

- Added [`DOCS/WORKING_NOTES.md`](WORKING_NOTES.md): a live, editable log of
  in-progress work, so a crashed editor/terminal/assistant session can be
  resumed from a known state instead of re-derived from scratch.
- Added [`DOCS/PC_PORT_ROADMAP.md`](PC_PORT_ROADMAP.md): a phased,
  date-free plan covering what's needed to get the game running natively on
  PC with keyboard, mouse, and controller input in a playable state, plus a
  longer-term modern-graphics phase (resolution scaling, widescreen, texture
  filtering/HD packs, enhanced lighting). No PC-port work has started; this
  is planning only.
- Linked both from the `DOCS/README.md` reading order.

### Asset formats

- Added [`DOCS/ASSET_FORMATS.md`](ASSET_FORMATS.md) documenting the asset
  compression (`rzip`), the offset-table container format (confirmed against
  `func_1502B9B4` in `game_57FA0.c`), and per-type payloads.
- Confirmed findings against the retail US ROM and the debug prototype:
  RGBA5551 textures (assets00–05), MP3 streams (assets16), the `"B1"` audio bank
  header (assets17, 22050 Hz + 170-entry sample table), and container payloads.
- Corrected the earlier "assets06 = models" assumption: assets06 is composite
  object/script data (positions, float params, dialogue strings). assets08 is
  chapter-select metadata.
- Decoded the `assets13` model geometry: four-level-nested containers whose leaf
  records are `s16` XYZ vertex arrays (6 bytes/vertex, zero-padded to 16 bytes),
  validated across all 69 records; near-identical arrays within a block are
  vertex-animation frames.
- Established that `assets13` holds **only** vertex positions - 0 display-list
  markers across all 69 records - so face/UV/normal/material data is stored
  separately or built at runtime; locating it needs the model-drawing code.
- Linked the new doc from the `DOCS/README.md` reading order.

### GitHub Actions

- Updated checkout steps from `actions/checkout@v4` to `actions/checkout@v7` so workflows use the Node 24-compatible action.
- Changed the ROM build workflow to skip baserom-dependent steps when `PRIVATE_REPO_ACCESS` or `CONKER_BASEROM_US` is missing.
- Added clear workflow notices explaining which secrets are needed to enable the full ROM build.

### Documentation

- Moved repository-owned README content into the `DOCS/` folder.
- Added the `DOCS/README.md` documentation index.
- Rewrote the project overview, code sub-project notes, compressed config notes, and IDO toolchain notes for clearer reading.
- Added this update log.
- Added `DOCS/ASSET_FORMATS.md` documenting the rzip codec, the offset-table archive container (including the previously undocumented nested-compression layer inside model files), and the model/texture/audio/table payload formats.
